# VIDEO MANAGER STUDIO CLASSIC
## Version 0.1

Hi there! This is my first project on python. <br />

This is simple video manager (VMS or CMS... i'm think this is nevermind) for my job. <br />
I try use OpenCV and Thinker for this project. <br />
Sorry to my English, my English is not so good... <br />

### Project Plan
"Nobody ever wrote down a plan to be broke, fat, lazy, or stupid. Those things are what happen when you don’t have a plan." — Larry Winget <br /> <br />

```diff
+ 1. Make a window. 100%
- 2. Make more windows inside the main window. 0%
- 3. The window must show us the real time video with cameras. 0%
- 4. To finish the plan. 10%
```
<br /> <br />
I want to output the real time video to window through rtsp-url.
