# VIDEO MANAGER STUDIO CLASSIC
## Version 0.4

Hi there! This is my first project on python. <br />

This is simple video manager (VMS or CMS... i'm think this is nevermind) for my job. <br />
I try use OpenCV and Thinker for this project. <br />
Sorry to my English, my English is not so good... <br />
Qt look like better then tkiner... but this is code look is bad. <br /> :C
